            <p>I love music and computers. I play three musical insturments: the trumpet, the flute, and the electric
              guitar. I have played
              trumpet and flute for five years, and electric guitar for one year. It's a rush when you get it right. It
              took a lot of practice to get to that point, but it is well worth it. I also write my own music, so I will
              not get tired of other people's music.
            <p>I have been using computers since they came out for the consumer in the 1990's. I was building them by
              1999, and I built two of them. The computer I use today is a really high-end gaming PC. It cost $7,200. It
              has the latest processor, RAM, graphics card, and a NMVe hard drive. It has 8 terabytes of storage space.
              I love
              working on it because you do not have to wait for anything, everything loads real quickly. I also have a
              virtual reality system and I play virtual reality games some of the time.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-opacity"><b>What I've learned from this class</b></h3>
            <p>My degree plan is in PC support, so
              learning
              about making webpages falls into that category. I've learned about the language that we use to make
              webpages, and I've learned how to take projects and read the instructions, and put them together. I liked
              learning how to add the pictures best out of all the assignments.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-opacity"><b>What this class can do for me</b></h3>
            <p>This class adds to my curriculum of knowledge and gives me more understanding about computers and
              computer related things. My degree plan is in PC support, so anything pertaining to PCs is what you would
              want to know, the more the better. I believe that this class will help me get a job in the sense of being
              a well rounded computer person who knows all about computers.</p><br>

            <p>My gaming PC, which I described above, makes for easy use of the computer. I never have to wait on
              anything to load, it makes doing your homework a real pleasure.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-opacity"><b>Techniques</b></h3>
            <p>I put on music on my computer, then I go to work. I spend about 30 minutes to 1 hour, but sometimes 2
              hours, in sessions on my computer. It just depends on the assignment.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-opacity"><b>Methods</b></h3>
            <p>I have found that having a fun computer to work on makes all the difference in the world. I had a $3,200
              computer before my current one, and I gave it to my mom and step-dad as a free gift after I got my new
              computer. I did that because I strongly believe in powerful computers when people need a computer to use.
              They are so much fun! I find myself doing assignments a lot of the time just so I can spend time in front
              of it. I also wake up early every day and start on my school work. On the
              weekends I work at Arby's restaurant to earn money. So, the first part of the week I work on school, then
              I
              work the last part of the week at my job. I like my routine because it is well planned and balanced.</p>
