                <dd>INXS were originally called<q>The Farriss Brothers</q>. They were founded in 1977 in Sydney, New
                    South Wales. There were three Farriss brothers in the band: Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, and Tim
                    Farriss. Andrew Farriss was the main composer and keyboardist, Jon Farriss was the drummer, and Tim
                    Farriss was the guitarist</dd>

                <dd>Michael Hutchence. He was born January 22, 1960, and died in November 22 1997. He co-founded INXS.
                    INXS has sold over 50 million records worldwide and were inducted to the Australian Recording
                    Industry Association in 2001. He was the lead singer and lyricst for INXS. In July 1996, he and
                    Paula Yates had a daughter. He was also an actor.</dd>

                <dd>On November 22, 1997, Michael Hutchence was found dead in his hotel room. After being involved with
                    drugs and alcohol, he committed suicide by hanging himself. There was also an on going custody
                    battle between him and Paula Yates with their daughter. Michael Hutchence was frightened and was
                    troubled by the custody battle. The death was ruled suicide while depressed and under the influence
                    of
                    alcohol and other drugs.</dd>

                <dd>INXS started in 1977 with the Farriss brothers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, and Tim Farriss. In
                    1978, three more members joined, Michael Hutchence, Garry Gary Beers, and Kirk Pengilly. After
                    Michael Hutchence died, INXS did not perform publiclyy for almost a year. They made a few
                    performances with different guest singers untill the year 2000. Around 2004, the band hosted
                    contests to find a new lead singer for the band. INXS toured in Australia and New Zealand in 2007.
                    The band continued to tour, doing performances for the Olympic Winter Games and other performances
                    up until 2012.

                <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
                <dd>The song <q>Need You Tonight</q> is INXS's most popular song. It was released in 1987 as part of
                    their <q>Kick</q> album. This was the only INXS song that reached number one on the Billboard Hot
                    100. Other songs, such as <q>What You Need</q> was a top five Billboard hit. All their songs
                    were good though, I would say they were all well rounded, which is what you want if you are writing
                    music. There is no point in having one hit song, if we cannot replicate the experience and put some
                    of
                    that energy into all the songs. Even though <q>Need You Tonight</q> is the most popular song
                    according
                    to charts, my favorite song from INXS was <q>Mystify</q>. It shows that INXS music applies to lots
                    of
                    different tastes. I would also say <q>Never Tear Us Apart</q> is another one of my favorites that is
                    not
                    a major hit on the charts.</dd>

                <dd>After 35 years, the band played their last performance in Perth, Australia in 2012. They did not say
                    the band would permanently retire though. In an Australian television interview, Jon Farriss said
                    <q>Never say never</q>, meaning the band might record and play more music in the future. The years
                    after 2012 included a television miniseries about the band. And in 2019, a documentary film called
                    <q>Mystify</q> was released about Michael Hutchence.

                <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
                <dd>INXS played what is called new wave/pop style music. Later, the band developed a pub style rock that
                    included funk and dance elements. I would say they sound similar to the <q>Fine Young Cannibals</q>
                    in their hit <q>She Drives Me Crazy</q>. It is like it is rock, but it is not like <q>Led
                        Zeppelin</q>, or <q>The Rolling Stones</q>. Music from the previous two artists is kind of hard.
                    INXS was more upbeat and had a touch of uplifting to it. I would also use the term pop to
                    describe their music because it is more like <q>U2</q>, or <q>Coldplay</q>. Not really hard, but
                    softer and <em>well rounded</em>.</dd>

                <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
                <dd>The latest lead singer was Ciaran Gribbin. He is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter, guitarist and
                    producer. J.D. Fortune was the previous lead singer for INXS. He was the winner of the competition
                    INXS hosted to search for a new lead singer. The band also recorded an album in memory of Michael
                    Hutchence called <q>Original Sin</q>. Ben Harper, Patrick Monahan from the band <q>Train</q>, and
                    Rob Thomas from the band <q>Matchbox Twenty</q> were all featured in the album. Train, and
                    Matchbox Twenty and both of their lead singers are another favorite of mine too. Patrick Monahan has
                    some real talent as seen in his <q>Drops of Jupiter</q> song. And Rob Thomas has several good hits
                    as
                    well.</dd>

                <dd><q>Kick</q> was INXS's best selling album. It was certified six times platinum and it peaked at
                    number three on the Billboard 200. Sales for <q>Kick</q> were about 20 million by 2012. Rolling
                    Stone rated <q>Kick</q> at number three in <q>Best Albums of the Year</q> in 1988. Other albums are
                    <q>INXS</q>, <q>Underneath the Colours</q>, <q>X</q>, and <q>Elegantly Wasted</q>.

                <dd>Andrew Farriss had a band called <q>Doctor Dolphin</q> and he asked his then high school classmate,
                    Michael Hutchence to join him. The band had a few other people. After that the Farriss brothers
                    teamed up with Garry Gary Beers and Kirk Pengilly and made their debut on August 16, 1977 at Whale
                    Beach, north of Sydney. The band's first performance as INXS was on September 1, 1979, at the Ocean
                    Beach Hotel in Umina, New South Wales.</dd>

                <dd>Yes, he was friends with the lead singer from the Irish band U2, Bono, and the band Duran Duran.
                    Bono
                    broke off their friendship though three years before Michael Hutchence's suicide because of his drug
                    use.</dd>
